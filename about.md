While this should be self-explanatory, this blog is primarily a place for me to store my more refined notes, generally on the subject of machine learning and data science. A caveat: everything I post will only be lightly researched and mostly derived from my own thoughts on a subject, which could be wrong! So please email me directly at [robert@ryi.me](mailto:robert@ryi.me) or leave a comment if that is the case, and Iâ€™ll give it some more thought and revise.
